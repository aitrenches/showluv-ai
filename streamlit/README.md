# **Energy Consumption Forecaster**

## **Overview**
Welcome to the **Energy Consumption Forecaster**, a tool designed to analyze and forecast energy consumption for residential estates using Photrek's Risk-Aware Assessment Service. This application was built for the **SingularityNET Platform Hackathon**, leveraging the SingularityNET SDK to integrate Photrekâ€™s robust metrics: **Accuracy**, **Decisiveness**, and **Robustness**.

By providing probabilistic forecasts for energy consumption, this tool empowers users with actionable insights into energy usage patterns, helping them make informed decisions about energy efficiency and management.

## **Core Features**
1. **Streamlit Frontend**:
   - Upload a CSV file containing probabilistic energy forecasts.
   - View visualizations of the input data and results.
   - Receive detailed metrics, including Accuracy, Decisiveness, and Robustness.
   - Access a dynamically generated chart based on Photreks assessment.

2. **Django Backend**:
   - Processes uploaded CSV files and prepares them for Photrek's service.
   - Validates API keys for secure access.
   - Interacts with Photrekâ€™s Risk-Aware Assessment Service via the SingularityNET SDK.
   - Returns metrics and a base64-encoded image for visualization.

## **How It Works**
### **Frontend (Streamlit)**

The Streamlit app serves as the primary interface:
- Users upload a CSV file formatted to Photrek's requirements (no headers, N probability columns, and one outcome column).
- The app validates the input, communicates with the Django backend, and visualizes the results.

### **Backend (Django)**
The Django backend powers the analysis workflow:
1. **Authentication**: API keys are validated before any processing occurs.
2. **File Ingestion**: Uploaded CSV files are read and transformed into a base64-encoded string required by Photrek's service.
3. **Integration with Photrek**: Using the SingularityNET SDK, the backend sends the processed data to Photrek's `adr` method and retrieves the results.
4. **Protobuf Serialization**: The response from Photrek (in Protobuf format) is deserialized into JSON for consumption by the Streamlit app.
5. **Result Metrics**:
   - **Accuracy**: Evaluates how well the forecast matches actual outcomes.
   - **Decisiveness**: Assesses decision-making confidence.
   - **Robustness**: Measures performance in low-probability scenarios.

## **Key Components**

### **1. `streamlit/energy_forecaster.py`**
- Handles the Streamlit frontend.
- Allows users to:
  - Input an API key.
  - Upload a CSV file for analysis.
  - View the results, including:
    - Key metrics (Accuracy, Decisiveness, Robustness).
    - The number of rows and columns processed.
    - A dynamically generated chart visualizing probabilities.

### **2. `backend/views.py`**
- Contains the `EnergyForecastAPI` Django class-based view.
- Key functionalities:
  - Validates API keys using custom middleware.
  - Ingests and processes CSV files with the `ingest_csv` function.
  - Interacts with the SingularityNET SDK to call Photrekâ€™s service.
  - Returns a JSON response with metrics and visualization data.
